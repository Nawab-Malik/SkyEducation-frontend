## ‚ö†Ô∏è Most Common Reasons Emails Don't Arrive

### 1. **EmailJS Template Configuration Issues**

#### ‚úÖ Check Your EmailJS Dashboard

1. Go to: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/templates
2. Find template: `template_h850n5q`
3. Click "Edit"
4. **CRITICAL**: Verify the "To Email" field

**The template should have:**
```
To Email: {{to_email}}
```

**NOT hardcoded like:**
```
To Email: Info@skyeducationltd.com  ‚ùå WRONG
```

The `{{to_email}}` variable allows your code to dynamically set the recipient.

---

### 2. **Gmail Spam/Junk Folder**

EmailJS emails often land in spam initially.

**Check:**
1. Open Gmail: https://mail.google.com/
2. Click "Spam" or "Junk" folder on the left
3. Look for emails from your EmailJS service
4. If found, mark as "Not Spam"

---

### 3. **EmailJS Service Not Connected to Gmail**

Your EmailJS service might not be properly connected to `Info@skyeducationltd.com`.

**Fix:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin
2. Click "Email Services" tab
3. Find service: `service_fsujzya`
4. Check if it shows your Gmail: `Info@skyeducationltd.com`
5. If not, click "Add New Service" ‚Üí Choose Gmail ‚Üí Connect `Info@skyeducationltd.com`
6. Update the SERVICE_ID in your code if you create a new service

---

### 4. **EmailJS Free Plan Limits**

**Free Plan Limits:**
- 200 emails per month
- 2 emails per second

**Check if you've hit the limit:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/account
2. Check "Usage" section
3. If at 200/200, you need to wait for next month or upgrade

---

### 5. **Template Variables Mismatch**

Your code sends these variables:
```javascript
{
  to_email: 'Info@skyeducationltd.com',
  from_name: 'Student Name',
  from_email: 'student@email.com',
  phone: '1234567890',
  course: 'Course Name',
  message: 'Message text'
}
```

**Your EmailJS template MUST include ALL these variables:**
```
{{to_email}}
{{from_name}}
{{from_email}}
{{phone}}
{{course}}
{{message}}
```

If any variable is missing in the template, EmailJS will fail silently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Verify Template "To Email" Field

In EmailJS dashboard, your template's "To Email" should be:
```
{{to_email}}
```

NOT:
```
Info@skyeducationltd.com
```

### Fix 2: Check Gmail Settings

1. Go to Gmail Settings (gear icon ‚Üí "See all settings")
2. Click "Filters and Blocked Addresses"
3. Make sure EmailJS emails aren't blocked
4. Check "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" - ensure IMAP is enabled

### Fix 3: Whitelist EmailJS in Gmail

1. Add `noreply@emailjs.com` to your Gmail contacts
2. This helps prevent emails from going to spam

### Fix 4: Check Email Service Status

1. Go to: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin
2. Click "Email Services"
3. Your service should show "Active" status
4. If it shows "Error" or "Disconnected", reconnect it

## üÜò Still Not Working?

### Run This Test:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Paste this code:
```javascript
emailjs.send(
  'service_fsujzya',
  'template_h850n5q',
  {
    to_email: 'Info@skyeducationltd.com',
    from_name: 'Console Test',
    from_email: 'test@test.com',
    phone: '0000000000',
    course: 'Debug Test',
    message: 'Testing from console'
  }

  (error) => console.error('‚ùå ERROR:', error)
);
```
3. Press Enter
4. Check the console output
5. Check your Gmail

### If Console Test Works But Form Doesn't:

3. Wrong Public Key
4. Template variables mismatch
5. Service not connected to Gmail
