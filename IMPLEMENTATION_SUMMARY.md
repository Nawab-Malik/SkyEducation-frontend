## 🔄 Before & After

### Before:
```
User clicks "ENROLL NOW" → Navigate to /enroll → Pass course via state
URL: /enroll (same for all courses)
```

### After:
```
User clicks "ENROLL NOW" → Navigate to /enroll/course-name
URL: /enroll/mot-class-1-2 (unique for each course)
```

## 📝 Code Changes

### 1. App.js - Router Configuration
```javascript
// BEFORE
<Route path="/enroll" element={<EnrollmentPage />} />

// AFTER
<Route path="/enroll/:courseId" element={<EnrollmentPage />} />
<Route path="/enroll" element={<EnrollmentPage />} /> {/* Fallback */}
```

### 2. Courses.js - Navigation Logic
```javascript
// BEFORE
const handleEnrollClick = (course) => {
  navigate("/enroll", { state: { course } });
};

// AFTER
const handleEnrollClick = (course) => {
  if (course.shortName) {
    navigate(`/enroll/${course.shortName}`);
  } else {
    navigate("/enroll", { state: { course } });
  }
};
```

### 3. Enrollment.js - Course Lookup
```javascript
// BEFORE
const courseData = location.state?.course;

// AFTER
const { courseId } = useParams();
const [courseData, setCourseData] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (courseId) {
    const course = findCourseByShortName(courseId);
    if (course) {
      setCourseData(course);
    } else {
      navigate('/courses');
    }
  } else if (location.state?.course) {
    setCourseData(location.state.course);
  }
}, [courseId, location.state, navigate]);
```

### 4. CourseData.js - Added shortName
```javascript
// BEFORE
{
  id: 2,
  title: "Level 3 Award in Education & Training",
  desc: "...",
  img: getCourseImage("icq", 1),
}

// AFTER
{
  id: 2,
  title: "Level 3 Award in Education & Training",
  shortName: "level-3-award-education-training",
  desc: "...",
  img: getCourseImage("icq", 1),
}
```

## 🎨 URL Examples

| Course Title | URL |
|-------------|-----|
| Level 3 Award in Education & Training | `/enroll/level-3-award-education-training` |
| MOT Class 1 & 2 | `/enroll/mot-class-1-2` |
| PROQUAL Level 2 First Aid | `/enroll/proqual-level-2-first-aid` |
| Entry Level 1 English | `/enroll/entry-level-1-english` |

## ✅ Features Implemented

- [x] Dynamic routing with React Router v6
- [x] Unique URL for each course
- [x] useParams() to extract courseId from URL
- [x] Course lookup utility function
- [x] Backward compatibility with old navigation
- [x] Error handling for invalid course URLs
- [x] Automatic redirect for non-existent courses
- [x] SEO-friendly URL structure
- [x] Shareable course enrollment links

## 🔧 Technical Details

### React Router v6 Features Used:
- `useParams()` - Extract URL parameters
- `useNavigate()` - Programmatic navigation
- `useLocation()` - Access location state (fallback)
- Dynamic route segments (`:courseId`)

### Utility Functions:
```javascript
// Generate URL-friendly name from title
generateShortName(title) → "course-name"

// Find course by shortName across all categories
findCourseByShortName(shortName) → course object

// Get all courses from all categories
getAllCourses() → array of courses
```

## 📈 Benefits
